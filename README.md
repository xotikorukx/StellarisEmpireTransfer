Don't even bother with V1 (though the releases with the "working" v1 will stay and be "usable"). V2 is a few workhours and some testing away from being ready, and is actually sane and usable.

Todos:
- EmpireScreen options (5ish workhours?)
- Github autoupdater (10ish workhours?)
- Ensure userprefs are backward compatible (3ish workhours?)
- host the server (1ish workhour?)
- Test! (2ish workhours?)
